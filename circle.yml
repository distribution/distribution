    # TODO(stevvooe): The following is an attempt at using goveralls but it
    # just doesn't work. goveralls requires a single profile file to be
    # submitted at once, but can't run all of the tests for all the packages
    # at once. The command below attempts to fix this but fails because it
    # creates a new "job" for run of coveralls, making it so that the coverage
    # is partially reported a large number of times.

    # - cd $HOME/.go_project/src/github.com/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME && go list ./... | xargs -I{} goveralls -service circleci -repotoken $COVERALLS_TOKEN -race {}
