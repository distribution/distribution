As of v2.4.0 a garbage collector command is included within the registry binary.
This document describes what this command does and how and why it should be used.

## About garbage collection

In the context of the registry, garbage collection is the process of
removing blobs from the filesystem when they are no longer referenced by a
manifest. Blobs can include both layers and manifests.

Registry data can occupy considerable amounts of disk space. In addition,
garbage collection can be a security consideration, when it is desirable to ensure
that certain layers no longer exist on the filesystem.

## Garbage collection in practice

Filesystem layers are stored by their content address in the Registry. This
has many advantages, one of which is that data is stored once and referred to by manifests.
See [here](compatibility.md#content-addressable-storage-cas) for more details.

Layers are therefore shared amongst manifests; each manifest maintains a reference
to the layer. As long as a layer is referenced by one manifest, it cannot be garbage
collected.

Manifests and layers can be `deleted` with the registry API (refer to the API
documentation [here](../spec/api.md#deleting-a-layer) and
[here](../spec/api.md#deleting-an-image) for details). This API removes references
to the target and makes them eligible for garbage collection. It also makes them
unable to be read via the API.

If a layer is deleted, it is removed from the filesystem when garbage collection
is run. If a manifest is deleted the layers to which it refers are removed from
the filesystem if no other manifests refers to them.


### Example

In this example manifest A references two layers: `a` and `b`. Manifest `B` references
layers `a` and `c`. In this state, nothing is eligible for garbage collection:

```
A -----> a <----- B
    \--> b     |
         c <--/
```

Manifest B is deleted via the API:

```
A -----> a     B
    \--> b
         c
```

In this state layer `c` no longer has a reference and is eligible for garbage
collection. Layer `a` had one reference removed but not garbage
collected as it is still referenced by manifest `A`. The blob representing
manifest `B` is eligible for garbage collection.

After garbage collection has been run, manifest `A` and its blobs remain.

```
A -----> a
    \--> b
```


### More details about garbage collection

Garbage collection runs in two phases. First, in the 'mark' phase, the process
scans all the manifests in the registry. From these manifests, it constructs a
set of content address digests. This set is the 'mark set' and denotes the set
of blobs to *not* delete. Secondly, in the 'sweep' phase, the process scans all
the blobs and if a blob's content address digest is not in the mark set, the
process deletes it.


> **Note**: You should ensure that the registry is in read-only mode or not running at
> all. If you were to upload an image while garbage collection is running, there is the
> risk that the image's layers are mistakenly deleted leading to a corrupted image.

This type of garbage collection is known as stop-the-world garbage collection.

## Run garbage collection

Garbage collection can be run as follows

`bin/registry garbage-collect [--dry-run] [--delete-untagged] [--quiet] /path/to/config.yml`

The garbage-collect command accepts a `--dry-run` parameter, which prints the progress
of the mark and sweep phases without removing any data. Running with a log level of `info`
gives a clear indication of items eligible for deletion.

The config.yml file should be in the following format:

```yaml
version: 0.1
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /registry/data
```

_Sample output from a dry run garbage collection with registry log level set to `info`_

```

The `--delete-untagged` option can be used to delete manifests that are not currently referenced by a tag.

The `--quiet` option suppresses any output from being printed.
