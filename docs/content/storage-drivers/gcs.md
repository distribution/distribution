title: Google Cloud Storage driver
---

An implementation of the `storagedriver.StorageDriver` interface which uses Google Cloud for object storage.

## Parameters

| Parameter     | Required | Description |
|:--------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bucket`  | yes | The name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket where you wish to store objects (needs to already be created prior to driver initialization). |
| `keyfile`  | no | A private service account key file in JSON format used for [Service Account Authentication](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts). |
| `rootdirectory`  | no | The root directory tree in which all registry files are stored. Defaults to the empty string (bucket root). If a prefix is used, the path `bucketname/<prefix>` has to be pre-created before starting the registry. The prefix is applied to all Google Cloud Storage keys to allow you to segment data in your bucket if necessary.|
| `chunksize`  | no (default 5242880) | This is the chunk size used for uploading large blobs, must be a multiple of 256*1024. |
| `disablekeepalives` | no | Disables HTTP keep-alives on the HTTP tranport when `true`. Each connection to the server will be used for a single HTTP request. The default is `false`. |

{{< hint type=note >}}
Instead of a key file you can use [Google Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials).

To use redirects with default credentials assigned to a virtual machine you have to enable "IAM Service Account Credentials API" and grant `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` permission on the used service account.

To use redirects with default credentials from Google Cloud CLI, in addition to the permissions mentioned above, you have to [impersonate the service account intended to be used by the registry](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference#--impersonate-service-account).
