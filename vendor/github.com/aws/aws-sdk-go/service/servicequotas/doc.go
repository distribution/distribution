// requests to Service Quotas.

// With Service Quotas, you can view and manage your quotas easily as your AWS
// workloads grow. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number
// of resources that you can create in your AWS account. For more information,
// see the Service Quotas User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/).

// Using the Client
//
// To contact Service Quotas with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
