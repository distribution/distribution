// Package managedblockchain provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Managed Blockchain.
//
// Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing
// blockchain networks using open-source frameworks. Blockchain allows you to
// build applications where multiple parties can securely and transparently
// run transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central authority.
//
// Managed Blockchain supports the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source
// frameworks. Because of fundamental differences between the frameworks, some
// API actions or data types may only apply in the context of one framework
// and not the other. For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network
// members such as CreateMember and DeleteMember do not apply to Ethereum.
//
// The description for each action indicates the framework or frameworks to
// which it applies. Data types and properties that apply only in the context
// of a particular framework are similarly indicated.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/managedblockchain-2018-09-24 for more information on this service.

// See managedblockchain package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Managed Blockchain with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
