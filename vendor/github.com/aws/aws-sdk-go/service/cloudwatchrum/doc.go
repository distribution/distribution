// Package cloudwatchrum provides the client and types for making API
// requests to CloudWatch RUM.
//
// With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to collect
// client-side data about your web application performance from actual user
// sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load times, client-side
// errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see it all aggregated
// together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that your customers
// use.
//
//    <p>You can use the collected data to quickly identify and debug client-side
//    performance issues. CloudWatch RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your
//    application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error
//    messages, stack traces, and user sessions. You can also use RUM to understand
//    the range of end-user impact including the number of users, geolocations,
//    and browsers used.</p>

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
