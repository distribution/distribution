// Package auditmanager provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Audit Manager.
//
// Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data
// types, and errors.
//
// Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so
// that you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use
// it to assess the effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify
// compliance.
//
// Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments
// for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection
// of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are
// grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard
// or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support
// internal audits with specific requirements.
