// Package configservice provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Config.
//
// Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the Amazon
// Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account.
// You can use Config to get the current and historical configurations of each
// Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship
// between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute
// Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic
// network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources
// currently supported by Config, see Supported Amazon Web Services resources
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources).
//
// You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management
// Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services
// CLI), the Config API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference
// guide contains documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services
// CLI commands that you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the Signature
// Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to
// sign a request with this protocol, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
// For detailed information about Config features and their associated actions
// or commands, as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console,
// see What Is Config (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
// in the Config Developer Guide.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Config with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
