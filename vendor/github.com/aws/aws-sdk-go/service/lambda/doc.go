// Package lambda provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Lambda.
//
// Overview
//
// Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or
// managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure
// and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including
// server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic
// scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually
// any type of application or backend service. For more information about the
// Lambda service, see What is Lambda (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
// in the Lambda Developer Guide.
//
// The Lambda API Reference provides information about each of the API methods,
// including details about the parameters in each API request and response.
//
// You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment
// (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation
// instructions, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see Lambda
// endpoints and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference..
//
// When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by
// providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information,
// see Signature Version 4 signing process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference..
//
// CA certificates
//
// Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer,
// changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause
// connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these
// failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system
// up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do
// not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist
// with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system
// and Java versions:
//
//    * Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later
//    installed contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.
//
//    * Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007),
//    Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one
//    of the required CAs in their trust list.
//
//    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and
//    7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted
//    CA list.
//
//    * Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions,
//    including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the
//    required CAs in their default trusted CA list.
//
// When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether
// through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client
// machines support any of the following CAs:
//
//    * Amazon Root CA 1
//
//    * Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2
//
//    * Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority
//
// Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from Amazon
// trust services (https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/), but keeping your
// computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about
// ACM-provided certificates, see Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager FAQs.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Lambda with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
