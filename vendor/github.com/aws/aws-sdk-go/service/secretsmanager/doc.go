// Logging API Requests
//
// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail,
// a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web
// Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using
// information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine
// the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request,
// when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
// and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services
// Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail)
// in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about
// CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the Amazon
// Web Services CloudTrail User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).
