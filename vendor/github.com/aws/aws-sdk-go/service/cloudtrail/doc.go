// Package cloudtrail provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CloudTrail.
//
// This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions,
// data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.
//
// CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for
// your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
// The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time
// of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters,
// and the response elements returned by the service.
//
// As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
// SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
// languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
// provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically
// signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For
// more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download
// and install them, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// See the CloudTrail User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
// for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services
// API call listed in the log files.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudtrail-2013-11-01 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS CloudTrail with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
