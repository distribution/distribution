// Package health provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Health APIs and Notifications.
//
// The Health API provides programmatic access to the Health information that
// appears in the Personal Health Dashboard (https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/).
// You can use the API operations to get information about events that might
// affect your Amazon Web Services services and resources.
//
//    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
//    plan from Amazon Web Services Support (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)
//    to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services
//    account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
//    Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.
//
//    * You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS)
//    to call the Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application
//    architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration.
//    You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which
//    Amazon Web Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information
//    from the API. For more information, see Accessing the Health API (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html)
//    in the Health User Guide.
//
// For authentication of requests, Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing
// Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
//
// If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations, you can use
// the Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized
// view of Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate
// Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that
// are affected by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities.
// Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return
// event information. For more information, see Aggregating Health events (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html)
// in the Health User Guide.
//
// When you use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the following
// recommendations:
//
//    * Use the eventScopeCode (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode)
//    parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public or
//    account-specific.
//
//    * Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if
//    you call the DescribeEventsForOrganization operation to get all events
//    in your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify
//    the nextToken in the next request to return more results.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Health APIs and Notifications with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// See the AWS Health APIs and Notifications client Health for more
// information on creating client for this service.
