// Package devopsguru provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon DevOps Guru.
//
// Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous
// behavior in business critical operational applications. You specify the Amazon
// Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the Amazon
// CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail events related to those
// resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru
// creates an insight that includes recommendations, related events, and related
// metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For more
// information, see What is Amazon DevOps Guru (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
//
// You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are
// notified every time a new insight is created. You can also enable DevOps
// Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each
// insight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights.
