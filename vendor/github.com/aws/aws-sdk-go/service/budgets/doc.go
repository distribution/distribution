// Package budgets provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Budgets.
//
// The Amazon Web Services Budgets API enables you to use Amazon Web Services
// Budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.
// The API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each
// of the actions and data types for Amazon Web Services Budgets.
//
// Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:
//
//    * How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits
//
//    * Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your Reserved
//    Instances (RIs)
//
//    * Your current estimated charges from Amazon Web Services, and how much
//    your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month
//
//    * How much of your budget has been used
//
// Amazon Web Services updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets
// track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create
// the following types of budgets:
//
//    * Cost budgets - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.
//
//    * Usage budgets - Plan how much you want to use one or more services.
//
//    * RI utilization budgets - Define a utilization threshold, and receive
//    alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see
//    if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.
//
//    * RI coverage budgets - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts
//    when the number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below
//    that threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered
//    by a reservation.
//
// Service Endpoint
//
// The Amazon Web Services Budgets API provides the following endpoint:
//
//    * https://budgets.amazonaws.com
//

// Budgets API, see Amazon Web Services Cost Management Pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Budgets with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
