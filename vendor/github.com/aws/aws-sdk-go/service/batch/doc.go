// Package batch provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Batch.
//
// Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services
// Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and
// engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages
// of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of
// configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also
// adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages,
// Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs
// submitted, thus effectively helping you to eliminate capacity constraints,
// reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.
//
// As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any
// scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload
// distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads.
// With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software.
// This means that you can focus your time and energy on analyzing results and
// solving your specific problems.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Batch with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
