// Package ram provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Resource Access Manager.
//
// This is the Resource Access Manager API Reference. This documentation provides
// descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM
// is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources
// across Amazon Web Services accounts. If you have multiple Amazon Web Services
// accounts, you can use RAM to share those resources with other accounts. If
// you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you share your resources
// with your organization or organizational units (OUs). For supported resource
// types, you can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management
// (IAM) roles an users.
//

// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Resource Access Manager with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
