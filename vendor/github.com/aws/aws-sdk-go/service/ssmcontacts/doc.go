// Package ssmcontacts provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager Contacts.
//
// Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed
// to help users mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their Amazon
// Web Services-hosted applications. An incident is any unplanned interruption
// or reduction in quality of services.
//
// Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of
// impact, highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration
// tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of
// reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager automates
// response plans and enables responder team escalation.
