  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard drive.</p> <p>To learn more, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon EC2: <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\">AmazonEC2 product page</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2\">Amazon EC2 documentation</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon EBS: <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ebs\">Amazon EBS product page</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ebs\">Amazon EBS documentation</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon VPC: <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/vpc\">Amazon VPC product page</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc\">Amazon VPC documentation</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services VPN: <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/vpn\">Amazon Web Services VPN product page</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpn\">Amazon Web Services VPN documentation</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

    "DescribeVolumeStatus": "<p>Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.</p> <p>The <code>DescribeVolumeStatus</code> operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:</p> <p> <i>Status</i>: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are <code>ok</code>, <code>impaired</code> , <code>warning</code>, or <code>insufficient-data</code>. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is <code>ok</code>. If the check fails, the overall status is <code>impaired</code>. If the status is <code>insufficient-data</code>, then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time.

For example, if your volume returns an <code>impaired</code> status, then the volume event might be <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.</p> <p> <i>Actions</i>: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is <code>impaired</code> and the volume event shows <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action shows <code>enable-volume-io</code>. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the <a>EnableVolumeIO</a> action and then check the volume for data consistency.</p> <p>Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the <code>error</code> state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)</p>",
