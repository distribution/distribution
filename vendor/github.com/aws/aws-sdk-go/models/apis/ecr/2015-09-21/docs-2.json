  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.</p> <p>Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html\">Amazon ECR endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>",

If it has been uploaded, then the image layer is skipped.</p> <note> <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push images.</p> </note>",
    "BatchDeleteImage": "<p>Deletes a list of specified images within a repository. Images are specified with either an <code>imageTag</code> or <code>imageDigest</code>.</p> <p>You can remove a tag from an image by specifying the image's tag in your request.
