  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Amazon ECR provides both public and private registries to host your container images. You can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\">Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference</a>.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "BatchCheckLayerAvailability": "<p>Checks the availability of one or more image layers within a repository in a public registry. When an image is pushed to a repository, each image layer is checked to verify if it has been uploaded before. If it has been uploaded, then the image layer is skipped.</p> <note> <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push images.</p> </note>",
    "BatchDeleteImage": "<p>Deletes a list of specified images within a repository in a public registry. Images are specified with either an <code>imageTag</code> or <code>imageDigest</code>.</p> <p>You can remove a tag from an image by specifying the image's tag in your request. When you remove the last tag from an image, the image is deleted from your repository.</p> <p>You can completely delete an image (and all of its tags) by specifying the image's digest in your request.</p>",
    "CompleteLayerUpload": "<p>Informs Amazon ECR that the image layer upload has completed for a specified public registry, repository name, and upload ID. You can optionally provide a <code>sha256</code> digest of the image layer for data validation purposes.</p> <p>When an image is pushed, the CompleteLayerUpload API is called once per each new image layer to verify that the upload has completed.</p> <note> <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images.
