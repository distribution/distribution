You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide\">Amazon EventBridge User Guide</a>.</p>",

Or, if all the accounts are members of the same Amazon Web Services organization, you can run <code>PutPermission</code> once specifying <code>Principal</code> as \"*\" and specifying the Amazon Web Services organization ID in <code>Condition</code>, to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.</p> <p>If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a <code>RoleArn</code> with proper permissions when they use <code>PutTarget</code> to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html\">Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts</a> in the <i>Amazon EventBridge User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The permission policy on the event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.</p>",

You can disable a rule using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_DisableRule.html\">DisableRule</a>.</p> <p>A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEventBus.html\">CreateEventBus</a>.</p> <p>If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this <code>PutRule</code> command. If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values.</p> <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.</p> <p>When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions.</p> <p>If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html\">TagResource</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html\">UntagResource</a>.</p> <p>Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p> <p>In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions. For Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams, Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html\">Authentication and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon EventBridge User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event.
