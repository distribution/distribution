  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname> <p> </p> <p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.</p> <p>Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.</p> <p>This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.</p> <p> <b>Amazon RDS API Reference</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>For the alphabetical list of API actions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html\">API Actions</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For the alphabetical list of data types, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html\">Data Types</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a list of common query parameters, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html\">Common Parameters</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of the error codes, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html\">Common Errors</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon RDS User Guide</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces\">Available RDS Interfaces</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For more information about how to use the Query API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Using_the_Query_API.html\">Using the Query API</a>.</p> </li> </ul>",

In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>PreSignedUrl</code> - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied.</p> <p>The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DestinationRegion</code> - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> looks like the following example: <code>arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html\"> Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\"> Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <note> <p>If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify <code>SourceRegion</code> (or <code>--source-region</code> for the CLI) instead of specifying <code>PreSignedUrl</code> manually. Specifying <code>SourceRegion</code> autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p> <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the same value as the <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> in the pre-signed URL. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> while that DB cluster snapshot is in \"copying\" status.</p> <p>For more information on copying encrypted Amazon Aurora DB cluster snapshots from one Amazon Web Services Region to another, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html\"> Copying a Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html\"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html\"> Multi-AZ deployments with two readable standby DB instances</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide.</i> </p>",

The Amazon RDS database software is preinstalled, so you need only select a DB engine and version, and create your database. With Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle, you upload your database installation files in Amazon S3.</p> <p>When you create a custom engine version, you specify the files in a JSON document called a CEV manifest. This document describes installation .zip files stored in Amazon S3. RDS Custom creates your CEV from the installation files that you provided. This service model is called Bring Your Own Media (BYOM).</p> <p>Creation takes approximately two hours. If creation fails, RDS Custom issues <code>RDS-EVENT-0196</code> with the message <code>Creation failed for custom engine version</code>, and includes details about the failure. For example, the event prints missing files.</p> <p>After you create the CEV, it is available for use. You can create multiple CEVs, and create multiple RDS Custom instances from any CEV. You can also change the status of a CEV to make it available or inactive.</p> <note> <p>The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the <code>CreateCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event aren't logged.
