  "service": "<p>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed nodes. A <i>managed node</i> is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, edge device, or on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) that has been configured for Systems Manager. </p> <note> <p>With support for IoT Greengrass core devices, the phrase <i>managed instance</i> has been changed to <i>managed node</i> in most of the Systems Manager documentation. The Systems Manager console, API calls, error messages, and SSM documents still use the term <i>instance</i>.</p> </note> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/\">Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed nodes.

  "operations": {
    "AddTagsToResource": "<p>Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=Dev</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Production</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Test</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.</p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. </p> <p>For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html\">Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>",

    "CreateAssociation": "<p>A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your managed nodes. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your managed nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service. </p>",

Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost. </p> <p>Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies.

But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters. </p> <p>If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter. </p> <p> <b>Using the Default Tier Configuration</b> </p> <p>In <code>PutParameter</code> requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in.

However, if you don't specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration.</p> <p>The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Advanced</b>: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Intelligent-Tiering</b>: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced. </p> <p>If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier.</p> <p>This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.</p> </li> <li> <p>The parameter uses a parameter policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about configuring the default tier option, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ps-default-tier.html\">Specifying a default parameter tier</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>",
