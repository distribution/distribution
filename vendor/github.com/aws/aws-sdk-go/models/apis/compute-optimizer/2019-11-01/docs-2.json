  "service": "<p>Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS volumes. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, in addition to projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity requirements.

For example, the recommended instance type uses a Nitro hypervisor and the current instance uses a Xen hypervisor. The differences that you should consider between these hypervisors are covered in the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#Nitro_Hypervisor\">Nitro Hypervisor</a> section of the Amazon EC2 frequently asked questions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances\">Instances built on the Nitro System</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux</i>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances\">Instances built on the Nitro System</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>NetworkInterface</code> </b> — The network interface of the recommended instance type is different than that of the current instance. For example, the recommended instance type supports enhanced networking and the current instance might not. To enable enhanced networking for the recommended instance type, you must install the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver or the Intel 82599 Virtual Function driver. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage\">Networking and storage features</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html\">Enhanced networking on Linux</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux</i>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage\">Networking and storage features</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/enhanced-networking.html\">Enhanced networking on Windows</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>StorageInterface</code> </b> — The storage interface of the recommended instance type is different than that of the current instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses an NVMe storage interface and the current instance does not. To access NVMe volumes for the recommended instance type, you will need to install or upgrade the NVMe driver. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage\">Networking and storage features</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html\">Amazon EBS and NVMe on Linux instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux</i>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage\">Networking and storage features</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html\">Amazon EBS and NVMe on Windows instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>InstanceStoreAvailability</code> </b> — The recommended instance type does not support instance store volumes and the current instance does. Before migrating, you might need to back up the data on your instance store volumes if you want to preserve them. For more information, see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/back-up-instance-store-ebs/\">How do I back up an instance store volume on my Amazon EC2 instance to Amazon EBS?</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Premium Support Knowledge Base</i>.

For more information about the differences between these virtualization types, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html\">Linux AMI virtualization types</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux</i>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/windows-ami-version-history.html#virtualization-types\">Windows AMI virtualization types</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Architecture</code> </b> — The CPU architecture between the recommended instance type and the current instance is different. For example, the recommended instance type might use an Arm CPU architecture and the current instance type might use a different one, such as x86. Before migrating, you should consider recompiling the software on your instance for the new architecture. Alternatively, you might switch to an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports the new architecture.
