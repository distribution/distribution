For example, \"I want to order a pizza\" and \"Can I order a pizza.\" You can't provide utterances for built-in intents.</p> </li> <li> <p>Information to be gathered.

You can specify standard slot types, such as date and time, or custom slot types for your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>How the intent is fulfilled. You can provide a Lambda function or configure the intent to return the intent information to your client application. If you use a Lambda function, Amazon Lex invokes the function when all of the intent information is available.</p> </li> <li> <p>A confirmation prompt to send to the user to confirm an intent. For example, \"Shall I order your pizza?\"</p> </li> <li> <p>A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent is fulfilled.
