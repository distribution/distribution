Amazon Web Services recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI.

There are two patterns: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for <code>REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1</code>. For <code>GetRightsizingRecommendation</code>, the Region is a full name (for example, <code>REGION==US East (N. Virginia)</code>. The <code>Expression</code> example is as follows:</p> <p> <code>{ \"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", “us-west-1” ] } }</code> </p> <p>The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create <code>Expression</code> and <code>DimensionValues</code> objects using either <code>with*</code> methods or <code>set*</code> methods in multiple lines. </p> </li> <li> <p>Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple <code>Expression</code> types and the logical operators <code>AND/OR/NOT</code> to create a list of one or more <code>Expression</code> objects. By doing this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on <code>((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)</code>. The <code>Expression</code> for that is as follows:</p> <p> <code>{ \"And\": [ {\"Or\": [ {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] }}, {\"Tags\": { \"Key\": \"TagName\", \"Values\": [\"Value1\"] } } ]}, {\"Not\": {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [\"DataTransfer\"] }}} ] } </code> </p> <note> <p>Because each <code>Expression</code> can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an <code>Expression</code> object that creates an error.</p> </note> <p> <code> { \"And\": [ ... ], \"DimensionValues\": { \"Dimension\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [ \"DataTransfer\" ] } } </code> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>For the <code>GetRightsizingRecommendation</code> action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported.
