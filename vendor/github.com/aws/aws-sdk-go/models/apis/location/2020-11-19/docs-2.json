When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>TimeBased</code>, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.</p> <p>When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>DistanceBased</code> filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft).</p> <p>When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>AccuracyBased</code> filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m.
