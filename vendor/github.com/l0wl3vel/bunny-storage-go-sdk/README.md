# üêá Bunny.net Edge Storage Go Library

This is a new Library for using the Bunny.net Object Storage Service in Go. It has been heavily inspired by James Pond`s [bunnystorage-go](https://sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/bunnystorage-go/).


## ‚ùì Why another library?

I wrote this because of a open PR implementing Bunny.net as Object Storage in JuiceFS and the maintainers were a bit hesitant merging code with many homebrew dependencies. This is using just three battletested dependencies (fasthttp, uuid, logrus) and is about 200 lines of library code, excluding tests.

- The E2E test coverage is currently at about 80%
- Simple to use
- Uses [valyala/fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) under the hood to achive much better performance than other libraries.
- Implements Undocumented `Describe` funtion which allows to retrieve metadata for single, non-directory files.
- Implements [HTTP Range Downloads](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) for downloading segments of objects


## ü¶æ Getting Started

```bash
go get github.com/l0wl3vel/bunny-storage-go-sdk
```

```go
import "net/url"
import "github.com/l0wl3vel/bunny-storage-go-sdk"

endpoint, err := endpoint.Parse("https://la.storage.bunnycdn.com/mystoragezone/")
if err != nil	{
    panic(err)
}
bunnyclient = bunnystorage.NewClient(endpoint, password)

content := make([]byte, 1048576)
// Fill content with data

// The last argument controls if a checksum is included in the request
err := bunnyclient.Upload("foo/bar.txt", content, true)
if err != nil 	{
	panic(err)
}

```

## Developing

```
# Install pre-commit from https://pre-commit.com/

pre-commit install --install-hooks

# Make your changes

# Run the E2E tests
BUNNY_PASSWORD=<insert password> BUNNY_ENDPOINT=https://storage.bunnycdn.com/<zone-name> go test ./... -v
pre-commit run --all-files

# Commit your changes
git commit
```

## ü§î Further Ideas

[] Implement Pull Zone support

## üöÄ Performance

It is fast. The use-case built this library around is for a [JuiceFS](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs) storage backend, which requires low latency and high throughput. Using the other Bunny.net library which uses net/http I got around 200‚¨áÔ∏è 400‚¨ÜÔ∏è MiB/s from Hetzner N√ºrnberg to the Bunny Edge PoP.

With this library after moving to fasthttp I was able to achive 1 GB/s upload and 600 Mbit/s download.


# ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks to

- James Pond for creating the original [bunnystorage-go](https://sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/bunnystorage-go/) library, which allowed me to start prototyping my work on JuiceFS immediately
- Bunny.net for creating an awesome performing and attractively priced object storage solution
